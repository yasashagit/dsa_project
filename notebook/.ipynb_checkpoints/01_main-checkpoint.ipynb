    "A Balanced Tree is any Binary Tree (including BSTs) that maintains its height close to minimal after insertions and deletions.\n",
    "Examples include: AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees, and 2-3 Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to ensure performance stays predictable and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Process and Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The tree monitors its height or balance factor after each insertion/deletion.\n",
    "2) If the tree becomes too heavy on one side, it performs rotations to restore balance.\n",
    "3) Height is kept around $O(\\log n)$, ensuring fast searching.\n",
    "4) Balanced Trees guarantee efficient operations even with random input.\n",
    "5) They are widely used inside databases, index structures, and language runtimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Search: $O(\\log n)$, insert: $O(\\log n)$, delete: $O(\\log n)$ (Always guaranteed, unlike a normal BST.)"
